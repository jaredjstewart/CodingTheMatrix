## 1: (Task 2.12.1) Create Voting Dict
def create_voting_dict(strlist):
    """
    Input: a list of strings.  Each string represents the voting record of a senator.
           The string consists of 
              - the senator's last name, 
              - a letter indicating the senator's party,
              - a couple of letters indicating the senator's home state, and
              - a sequence of numbers (0's, 1's, and negative 1's) indicating the senator's
                votes on bills
              all separated by spaces.
    Output: A dictionary that maps the last name of a senator
            to a list of numbers representing the senator's voting record.
    Example: 
        >>> create_voting_dict(['Kennedy D MA -1 -1 1 1', 'Snowe R ME 1 1 1 1'])
        {'Snowe': [1, 1, 1, 1], 'Kennedy': [-1, -1, 1, 1]}

    You can use the .split() method to split each string in the
    strlist into a list; the first element of the list will be the senator's
    name, the second will be his/her party affiliation (R or D), the
    third will be his/her home state, and the remaining elements of
    the list will be that senator's voting record on a collection of bills.

    You can use the built-in procedure int() to convert a string
    representation of an integer (e.g. '1') to the actual integer
    (e.g. 1).

    The lists for each senator should preserve the order listed in voting data.
    In case you're feeling clever, this can be done in one line.

## 2: (Task 2.12.2) Policy Compare
def policy_compare(sen_a, sen_b, voting_dict):
    """
    Input: last names of sen_a and sen_b, and a voting dictionary mapping senator
           names to lists representing their voting records.
    Output: the dot-product (as a number) representing the degree of similarity
            between two senators' voting policies
    Example:
        >>> voting_dict = {'Fox-Epstein':[-1,-1,-1,1],'Ravella':[1,1,1,1]}
        >>> policy_compare('Fox-Epstein','Ravella', voting_dict)
        -2
    The code should correct compute dot-product even if the numbers are not all in {0,1,-1}.
        >>> policy_compare('A', 'B', {'A':[100,10,1], 'B':[2,5,3]})
        253
        
    You should definitely try to write this in one line.

## 3: (Task 2.12.3) Most Similar
def most_similar(sen, voting_dict):
    """
    Input: the last name of a senator, and a dictionary mapping senator names
           to lists representing their voting records.
    Output: the last name of the senator whose political mindset is most
            like the input senator (excluding, of course, the input senator
            him/herself). Resolve ties arbitrarily.
    Example:
        >>> vd = {'Klein': [1,1,1], 'Fox-Epstein': [1,-1,0], 'Ravella': [-1,0,0]}
        >>> most_similar('Klein', vd)

def least_similar(sen, voting_dict):
    """
    Input: the last name of a senator, and a dictionary mapping senator names
           to lists representing their voting records.
    Output: the last name of the senator whose political mindset is least like the input
            senator.
    Example:
